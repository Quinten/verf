# Some notes

This file keeps some notes of useful commands and links i use while developing.

### Local development server

For the moment there is no webpack-dev-server setup in this repo. But because es6 modules require a server, i test the examples during development with the `server.js` node script in the root of the repository.

The test server runs on http://localhost:4000

I mostly run it in the background until i have to reboot with

```
node server.js > /dev/null &!
```

### Colors

The following colors are used for the examples.
